# Archival Notice
I've decided to archive this project. I have no intention of developing it any farther now that I am in college.
I no longer have the time nor the want to continue work on it. It served an instrumental role in my learning
how to work with strings, file systems, and operating systems.

# Bash for Windows
This is a project written in Python that I have been working on off and on over the years. Bash for Windows
attempts to recreate a Bash-like environment that can work on Windows, that being versions of Windows
that isn't compatible with WSL or for people that don't want to use WSL.

## Installation
In the GitHub Page, go to the Releases tab and download the latest zip of the install files. Unzip that file
and run the Setup.exe file. There is also a Readme file in that zip file which will help guide you through the
Installation process.

## Uninstallation
Bash for Windows does not leave anything in the Windows Registry or deep in the file system. To remove Bash
for Windows from your system, simply remove the Bash for Windows folder that you chose to install Bash for
Windows into, and it will be off your system.
